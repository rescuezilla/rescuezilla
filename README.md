# Rescuezilla [![Build Status](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/actions/workflows/build-rescuezilla-iso.yml/badge.svg?event=push&branch=master)](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla/actions) [![Translation status](https://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/rescuezilla/-/svg-badge.svg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/rescuezilla/)

Rescuezilla is an easy-to-use disk cloning and imaging application that's fully compatible with Clonezilla — the industry-standard trusted by tens of millions.

Yes, Rescuezilla is the Clonezilla GUI (graphical user interface) that you might have been looking for. But Rescuezilla is more than a Clonezilla GUI!

Disk imaging is the process of making a backup of your computer's hard drive which is managed as files stored on an external hard drive, and 'disk cloning' is the process of making a direct copy without needing a third drive for temporary storage.

For many people, the alternative open-source tools such as Clonezilla are intimidating and difficult to use, so Rescuezilla provides an easy-to-use graphical environment like the leading commercial tools, Acronis True Image and Macrium Reflect.

It's worth noting that hard drive imaging and cloning is a very specialized task that's not necessarily the best solution for every user: it's worth researching whether a traditional file-based backup approach is more suitable for the specific problem you are looking to solve.

Rescuezilla can be booted on any PC or Mac from a USB stick, and has been carefully developed to be fully interoperable with the Clonezilla. This means Rescuezilla can restore backups created by Clonezilla, and backups created by Rescuezilla can be restored using Clonezilla!

Rescuezilla was forked from _Redo Backup and Recovery_ (now called Redo Rescue) because it had been abandoned for 7 years. Rescuezilla is more than a trivial fork: it has been carefully rebuilt from the ground up to be fully compatible with the industry-standard Clonezilla.

## Features

* Simple graphical environment anyone can use
* Creates backup images that are fully interoperable with the industry-standard Clonezilla
* Supports images made by all known open-source imaging frontends, including Clonezilla (see 'compatibility' section of download page)
* Also supports virtual machine images: VirtualBox (VDI), VMWare (VMDK), Hyper-V (VHDx), Qemu (QCOW2), raw (.dd, .img) and many more
* Access files from within images (including virtual machine images) using 'Image Explorer (beta)'
* Fully supports advanced environments such as Linux md RAID, LVM and no partition table (filesystem directly-on-disk)
* Supports cloning (for direct 'device-to-device' mode without needing a third drive for temporary storage)
* Boots from Live USB stick on any PC or Mac
* Full system backup, bare metal recovery, partition editing, data protection, web browsing, and more
* Extra tools for hard drive partitioning, factory reset, undeleting files
* Web browser for downloading drivers, reading documentation
* File explorer for copying and editing files even if system won't boot
* Based on Ubuntu and partclone
* Can unlock any bitlocked encrypted disk supported by [dislocker](https://github.com/Aorimn/dislocker) and backup them up unencrypted, which is quicker and uses less disk space.

Note: Rescuezilla does NOT yet _automatically_ shrink partitions to restore to disks _smaller_ than original. This feature will be added in future version.

## About Bitlocker Disk Decryption using Dislocker

Rescuezilla is now able to unlock bitlocker encrypted partitions (as long as they are supported by [dislocker](https://github.com/Aorimn/dislocker) and backup them unencrypted, using `partclone.ntfs`.
The advantages are that we don't need to backup empty disk space and that compressing the backup is effective again. So it saves time and disk space!

During tests, it was possible to backup up and restore a Windows 11 VM and it booted perfectly after the restore.

How it works:
* on the source partition list, there are 3 icons, which mean:
	* unencrypted disk
	* encrypted and locked (red, closed padlock)
	* encrypted and unlocked (green, opened padlock)
* Whenever clicking on a encrypted and locked disk, one has the option of typing the password to unlock it.

From the UI point of view, nothing else changes.

Under the hood:

* [dislocker](https://github.com/Aorimn/dislocker) fuse mounts the bitlocker encrypted disk is mounted to a temporary folder, which contains only one file, the unencrypted ntfs partition.
* Some metadata is added to `self.partitions_to_backup[partition_key]`
* both `_handle_ntfs_partition` (which calls ntfsfix) and the section that creates `partclone_cmd_list` are aware of the metadata above and therefore backup the unlocked file created by dislocker instead of the original partition

No code change had to be done on the restore method. The partition type is the same and `partclone.ntfs` is automatically infered to restore the partition using the above process.

One may use Windows to bitlock encrypt the disk again after the restore if needed.

Since [dislocker](https://github.com/Aorimn/dislocker) currently does not support the TPM module, one needs to encrypt the disk in a special way for it to work:

Using Windows 10 or 11, click on

    * Start Menu
    * type `run`
    * Go to "Local Computer Policy > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > BitLocker Drive Encryption > Operating System Drives"
    * Select the following Item: "Require additional authentication at startup"
    * Change the following:
        * Change the policy itself to "Enabled"
        * Uncheck "Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM"
        * Change "Configure TPM startup" to "Do not allow TPM"
        * Change "Configure TPM startup PIN" to "Require startup PIN with TPM"
        * Change "Configure TPM startup key" to "Do not allow startup key with TPM"
        * Change "Configure TPM startup key and PIN" to "Do not allow startup key and PIN with TPM"
        * Click "Apply" and "OK"

    * Now open an Adminstator Power Shell and type

```
gpupdate /force /target:computer
$SecureString = ConvertTo-SecureString "YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE" -AsPlainText -Force
Enable-BitLocker -MountPoint "C:" -EncryptionMethod Aes256 -PasswordProtector -Password $SecureString
```
