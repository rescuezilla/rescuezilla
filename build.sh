# Pack the 'image' subdirectory to become a bootable ISO 9660 image using xorrisofs (which is "xorriso" but using the mkisofs/genisoimage
# compatibility mode).
#
# Constructing bootable ISO 9660 images is likely to be very esoteric knowledge for most developers reading this, so to better understand
# how it works, here is a quick reference/glossary:
#
# * ISO9660 is a filesystem commonly used on DVDs/CDs (though the filesystem UDF is also widely used on DVDs, and also used with Blu-Ray).
# * The goal here is to create a bootable ISO9660 image that works as a USB stick on legacy BIOS (MBR partition table), EFI (including Secure Boot),
#   and CD boot (El Torito boot catalog).
# * "EFI systems normally boot from optical discs by reading a FAT image file in El Torito format and treating that file as an ESP". This is in
#   contrast to the typical hard drive where the EFI partition resides on the disk rather than as an filesystem image file.
# * Historically, ISO9660 images were commonly created by mkisofs. mkisofs is no longer maintained. Debian repositories contain a fork of mkisofs named
#   genisoimage (forked in 2006), but it too is no longer developed (no bug fixes or features). Fortunately, xorriso is a command-line utility which is
#   maintained, widely available, and provides a compatibility mode for mkisofs' much clearer and higher-level command-line usage. While this
#   compatibility mode is accessible by launching xorriso with the "-as mkisofs" argument, the alternate executable xorrisofs achieves the same goal
#   more conveniently and with its own manpage.
# * The ISO9660 specification has had a number of extensions over the years. They are important to better understand xorrisofs command-line arguments:
#   * Rock Ridge added POSIX-style attributes (eg, ownership) and was developed in the early 1990s (named after a fictional town from a 1974 movie)
#   * Joliet reduced filename restrictions and was released by Microsoft in the mid-1990s
#   * El Torito is the CD-ROM boot record specification, which was released in 1995 (named after the restaurant it was supposedly defined in)
#   * An ISO 9660 filesystem can contain an MBR (Master Boot Record), ESP (EFI System Partition) and GPT (GUID Partition Table) without hampering the
#     (up-to 63) El Torito boot records. The MBR/GPT is stored in the first 32KiB of the filesystem. For developers familiar to hard drive layouts,
#     it may seem like a strange concept to have the MBR partition table stored within filesystem, rather than before the filesystem definition.
#
# Note: `man xorriso` is not at all relevant here. Instead, use `man xorrisofs` for more information on the arguments below. Also please note xorrisofs
#       specifies long-options sometimes with single-dash but other times with two dashes.
