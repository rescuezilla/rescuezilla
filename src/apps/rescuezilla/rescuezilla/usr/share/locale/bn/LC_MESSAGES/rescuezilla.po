msgstr ""

msgid "This mode is for \"disk cloning\". Cloning means copying one drive and directly overwriting another drive. This is a direct one-step operation with no temporary storage required.\n"
"\n"
"Cloning is different to \"disk imaging\". Imaging means copying everything from one drive into very large files stored inside a folder on an external drive. Multiple images can be saved on the same external drive. These images can be restored back to the original disk, or to additional disks. In other words, for \"imaging\" the backup operation copies your drive to <i>files</i> that need to be stored on a drive at least temporarily before it can be restored.\n"
