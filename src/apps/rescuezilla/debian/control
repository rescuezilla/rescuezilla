Description: Graphical hard drive backup and restore
 Rescuezilla is an extremely easy-to-use graphical environment for hard drive
 backup and restore. For many people, the alternative open-source tools
 Clonezilla and SysRescueCD, are intimidating and difficult to use, so
 Rescuezilla provides an easy-to-use graphical environment like the leading
 commercial tools, Norton Ghost and Acronis True Image.
