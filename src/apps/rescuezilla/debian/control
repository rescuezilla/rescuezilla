Description: Graphical hard drive backup and restore
 Rescuezilla is an easy-to-use disk cloning and imaging application that's
 fully compatible with Clonezilla â€” the industry-standard trusted by tens
 of millions. For many people, the alternative open-source tools such as
 Clonezilla are intimidating and difficult to use, so Rescuezilla provides
 an easy-to-use graphical environment like the leading commercial tools,
 Acronis True Image and Macrium Reflect.
