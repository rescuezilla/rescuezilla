-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 1.0.6.1 (2020-06-26) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Skipped “Please remove the installation medium, then press ENTER” after shutdown (#87)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 1.0.6 (2020-06-18) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added 64-bit version (this fixes the slow transfer rates issue on systems with >16GB RAM) (#3)
* Added support for booting on EFI-only machines (including with Secure Boot enabled) [64-bit only] (#1)
* Switched ISOLINUX bootloader to GRUB affecting all boot approaches: BIOS, EFI and CD-ROM
* Upgraded OS base to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal) from 18.04 LTS (Bionic) [64-bit only] (#51)
* Ubuntu 20.04 has dropped 32-bit, so Rescuezilla 32-bit remains based on Ubuntu 18.04
* Fixed issue preventing backup/restore of drives smaller than typically ~40 megabytes (#55)
* Fixed broken GRUB backup affecting _some_ 1MiB-aligned filesystems on MBR-formatted disks,
  by copying all of “post-MBR gap” between MBR and first partition, not just typical 32KiB. (#50)
* Fixed a “stuck at 0%” issue when paths contain certain special characters (#15)
* Removed false menu items such as “(Windows Boot Manager, )” by correctly merging items (#69)
* Removed restrictions which prevented users entering special characters in filenames and paths
* Fixed use of silver “Bluebird” theme, replacing the dull grey default used by v1.0.5/v1.0.5.1 (#48)
* Increased logging of internal commands for improved ability to track down reported bugs
* Writes the log file into destination directory (so it always persists between reboots) (#61)
* Improved the error message when a mount (of CIFS/SMB network share) fails
* Adds boot menu item to enter “BIOS” firmware setup [EFI-boot only]
* Replaced Redo Backup logo with new Rescuezilla logo (with “Tux” pengiun mascot) (#62)

* Installs Rescuezilla frontend as a deb package, which increases flexibility of installation (#13)
* Moved scripts from tertiary File Hierarchy Standard (eg, /usr/local/sbin/rescuezilla) to secondary 
  FHS (eg, /usr/sbin/rescuezilla) as the rationale that scripts were “developed by the system 
  administrator of the system it is deployed on” is no longer valid when installing as a deb package
* Added GRUB packages to assist users who want to use Rescuezilla to perform a GRUB repair (#50)
* Minimized divergence of Rescuezilla 32-bit and 64-bit package environment: (see below)
* Replaced Chromium Web Browser with Firefox to avoid Ubuntu 20.04 snap-based packaging as snaps 
  cannot yet (#63) be installed in chroot-based environments (which the Rescuezilla build uses)
* Replaced unsupported ‘leafpad’ text editor with similarly lightweight ‘mousepad’ text editor
* Removed ‘maximus’ auto-maximize package (as behavior replaced by OpenBox config in v1.0.5)

  help achieve sustainable funding.
