  using Clonezilla can be restored using Rescuezilla, and vice versa :)

* Removed false menu items such as “(Windows Boot Manager, )” by correctly merging items (#69)

* Installs Rescuezilla frontend as a deb package, which increases flexibility of installation (#13)
* Moved scripts from tertiary File Hierarchy Standard (eg, /usr/local/sbin/rescuezilla) to secondary 
  FHS (eg, /usr/sbin/rescuezilla) as the rationale that scripts were “developed by the system 
  administrator of the system it is deployed on” is no longer valid when installing as a deb package
* Added GRUB packages to assist users who want to use Rescuezilla to perform a GRUB repair (#50)
* Minimized divergence of Rescuezilla 32-bit and 64-bit package environment: (see below)
* Replaced Chromium Web Browser with Firefox to avoid Ubuntu 20.04 snap-based packaging as snaps
