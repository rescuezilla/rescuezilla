-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 2.1 (2020-12-12) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added ‘Image Explorer’ (beta) to easily mount partclone images and extract files (#20)
  Currently based on partclone-nbd. Feature is extremely fast for uncompressed images.
  Both Clonezilla and Rescuezilla currently default to gzip compression which requires
  decompressing a lot of data so mounting and exploring images over 50GB is relatively slow.
* Added build based on Ubuntu 20.10 (Groovy) for improved NVidia graphics card support (#115)
* Fixed slow backup speed after mistakenly switching away from pigz multithreaded compression (#125)
* Fixed scan issue on some Redo Backup v0.9.8-v1.0.4, Rescuezilla v1.0.5-v1.0.6.1 images (#127)
* Added ability to cancel the image scan by closing the progress bar popup (#126)
* Displayed more progress details during drive query and image scan (#126)
* Ensured that (unlike Clonezilla), disks with >1024MB still have 1MB post-MBR gap backup (#131)
* Ensured all post-MBR gap always restored (whether 1MB or 1024MB), not just the first 256KB (#131)
* Fixed post-MBR gap backup being one 512-byte sector too large (#131)
* Fixed ability to specify the SMB/CIFS network share version field (#140)
* Fixed “dev-fs.list” image scanning errors with recent Clonezilla “testing” releases (#139)
* Ignored “sector-size” line in sfdisk partition table to maximize forward compatibility (#147)
* Considered failure to query optional drive geometry information as non-fatal error (#122)
* Ensured .info gets created for Microsoft Reserved Partitions to better match Clonezilla (#144)
* Fixed rounding error for drive/partition sizes, and removed python hurry.filesize library (#148)
* Improved handling of read-only destination drives during backup
* Added partclone-nbd v0.0.3 and partclone-utils v0.4.2 applications (#20)
* Added Brazilian Portuguese/Português brasileiro (pt-BR) translation by vinicioslc (obrigado!) (#128)
* Added Polish/Polski (pl-PL) translation by zeit439  (dzięki!) (#135) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 2.0 (2020-10-14) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Switched to creating backups in Clonezilla format for full interoperability with Clonezilla
  Rescuezilla is now a drop-in replacement to Clonezilla! (#4) This means backups created
  using Clonezilla can be restored using Rescuezilla, and vice versa :)
* Warning: Backups created with Rescuezilla v2.0 or newer cannot be restored using earlier
  versions of Rescuezilla. Backups created with older versions of Rescuezilla can still of
  course be restored with v2.0 or newer
* Added ability to restore individual partitions, and not overwrite partition table (#46)
* Rewrote the Rescuezilla frontend in the Python3 programming language (#49, #48, #111)

* Adapted GParted launcher script to temporarily shutdown file manager's one-click mount and
  prevent GParted and Rescuezilla from running at the same time, to reduce risk of conflicts
* Added GParted desktop shortcut
* Released Rescuezilla as standalone deb file for advanced users on Ubuntu 20.04 (#119)
* Disabled 32-bit ISO image temporarily until Python virtual environment configured (#120)
* Switched from unmaintained SLiM (Simple Login Manager) to LightDM for reliability (#101, #115)
* Separated 'Safe Mode' boot menu item to two: "Graphical fallback mode" and "Load USB into RAM"
* Disabled Linux time sync to prevent hardware clock modification (thanks zebradots!) (#107)
* Improved window auto-maximization settings for improved usability
* Switches from GTK Bluebird theme to Breeze theme (#52)
* Renamed existing photorec start menu shortcut to "Photograph deep scan" (112)
* Added start menu shortcut for the TestDisk command-line undelete / file recovery app (#112)
* Added nouveau-firmware package to improve support for ~2009 vintage NVidia graphics cards

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 1.0.6 (2020-06-18) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added support for booting on EFI-only machines (including with Secure Boot enabled) [64-bit only] (#1)
* Switched ISOLINUX bootloader to GRUB affecting all boot approaches: BIOS, EFI and CD-ROM
* Upgraded OS base to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal) from 18.04 LTS (Bionic) [64-bit only] (#51)
* Ubuntu 20.04 has dropped 32-bit, so Rescuezilla 32-bit remains based on Ubuntu 18.04
* Fixed issue preventing backup/restore of drives smaller than typically ~40 megabytes (#55)
* Fixed broken GRUB backup affecting _some_ 1MiB-aligned filesystems on MBR-formatted disks,
  by copying all of “post-MBR gap” between MBR and first partition, not just typical 32KiB. (#50)
* Fixed a “stuck at 0%” issue when paths contain certain special characters (#15)
* Removed false menu items such as “(Windows Boot Manager, )” by correctly merging items (#69)
* Removed restrictions which prevented users entering special characters in filenames and paths
* Fixed use of silver “Bluebird” theme, replacing the dull grey default used by v1.0.5/v1.0.5.1 (#48)

* Adds boot menu item to enter “BIOS” firmware setup [EFI-boot only]
* Replaced Redo Backup logo with new Rescuezilla logo (with “Tux” pengiun mascot) (#62)
* Switched ISO naming to eg, “rescuezilla-1.0.6-32bit.iso” from “redobackup-livecd-1.0.6.iso”
* Installs Rescuezilla frontend as a deb package, which increases flexibility of installation (#13)
* Moved scripts from tertiary File Hierarchy Standard (eg, /usr/local/sbin/rescuezilla) to secondary 
  FHS (eg, /usr/sbin/rescuezilla) as the rationale that scripts were “developed by the system 
  administrator of the system it is deployed on” is no longer valid when installing as a deb package
* Added GRUB packages to assist users who want to use Rescuezilla to perform a GRUB repair (#50)
* Minimized divergence of Rescuezilla 32-bit and 64-bit package environment: (see below)
* Replaced Chromium Web Browser with Firefox to avoid Ubuntu 20.04 snap-based packaging as snaps 
  cannot yet (#63) be installed in chroot-based environments (which the Rescuezilla build uses)
* Replaced unsupported ‘leafpad’ text editor with similarly lightweight ‘mousepad’ text editor
* Removed ‘maximus’ auto-maximize package (as behavior replaced by OpenBox config in v1.0.5)

  help achieve sustainable funding.
